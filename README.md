## Solving Day-to-Day Problems With Graphs

[Mathematical graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)) are data structures that represent a set of things called vertices, and a set of relationships among things called edges. Virtually any set of concepts can be mapped or modeled using mathematical graphs making them a "universal" data structure.

Graphs have entered the lexicon over the past several years given their fundamental importance to analyzing large amounts of data. But graphs are useful for modeling and solving complex problems on a smaller scale too.

April's talk will be about modeling concepts and solving complex day-to-day problems using graphs and the [Encapsule/jsgraph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsgraph) package: a light-weight in-process graph container and re-usable algorithms that make some really fancy stuff trivial to do in-process.
